            <h2>Summary, Important Considerations, and Tips</h2>
            <p>This 7-day meal plan is a whole-food, low-fat vegan (LFV) guide tailored for a 40-year-old with Type 2 Diabetes and a BMI of 19.1. The primary goals are stable blood sugar levels, weight maintenance, and optimal nutrition within the strict confines of the allowed foods list. The diet is rich in fiber from vegetables, millets, and fruits, which helps slow down sugar absorption. Healthy fats are included in moderation from whole sources like nuts and seeds. All meals are free from dairy, added oils, and refined sugars.</p>
            
            <h3>Important Points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blood Sugar Monitoring:</strong> It is crucial to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly, especially when starting a new diet plan. Check levels before meals and 2 hours after to see how your body responds to different foods. Consult your doctor to adjust medication if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Strict Adherence to Allowed Foods:</strong> This plan is based ONLY on the list of foods you provided. Do not introduce other foods, especially processed items, refined grains (like white rice or wheat), or added sugars, as they can negatively impact blood sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration is Key:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day (at least 8-10 glasses). Proper hydration is essential for kidney function and can help with blood sugar management. Herbal teas (without sugar) are also a good option.</li>
                <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> While the foods are healthy, portion sizes are critical for managing calorie intake and blood glucose. Pay close attention to the measurements provided, especially for grains, fruits, and nuts.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Meal Salads/Appetizers:</strong> Eating a small, fiber-rich salad or raw vegetable appetizer before your main meals (lunch and dinner) is a strategic way to increase satiety, improve digestion, and help blunt the post-meal glucose spike. This is a highly recommended practice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips For Success</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meal Prep:</strong> Spend some time on the weekend washing and chopping vegetables, and cooking a large batch of a staple millet (like sorghum or buckwheat). This will make assembling meals during the week much faster and easier.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> The calorie and portion estimates are a guideline. Since your BMI is in the healthy range, the goal is maintenance. If you feel overly hungry or too full, adjust portion sizes slightly. The key is consistency and monitoring your blood sugar response.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooking without Oil:</strong> Use water or vegetable broth for sautéing ('water-sautéing'). Use high-quality non-stick cookware. Baking, steaming, and boiling are your primary cooking methods. Parchment paper is excellent for baking without needing any fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> Complement this diet with regular physical activity, as approved by your doctor. A brisk 30-minute walk, especially after meals, can significantly help with insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor with Herbs and Spices:</strong> Since you're avoiding added salt and fats, make friends with herbs and spices. Garlic, ginger, turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, rosemary, and black pepper can add incredible flavor to your meals without any calories or sodium.</li>
            </ul>
